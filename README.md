### Hello Pythonistas! ðŸ‘‹

First of all, if you have not known me yet, please check it out my profile describe [here](https://github.com/andresalerno "My profile").


Along your professional solutions, even yourt studies, it is so important that you can share your ideas and portofolios.

I'm studying a very good web framework called [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) that I strongly recommend it.
